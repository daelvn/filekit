# filekit

filekit is a Lua library written in MoonScript that simplifies the methods used by [LuaFileSystem](http://keplerproject.github.io/luafilesystem/) and adds a bunch of other functions for checking whether files exist, getting octal permissions... It also serves as a drop-in replacement for the [ComputerCraft FS API](http://computercraft.info/wiki/Fs_(API)), so you might be able to write programs compatible with both platforms now.
